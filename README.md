Traffic Signal Violation Detection

This project is aimed at detecting and capturing the vehicles that violate traffic signals at intersections. The system utilizes computer vision algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze the video feed from the cameras installed at the intersection and flag any vehicles that disobey the traffic signals.
Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Run the application using python traffic_signal.py.

Features

The system offers the following features:

    Real-time detection of traffic signal violations at intersections
    Accurate and reliable detection using computer vision algorithms and machine learning techniques
    Capturing and storing images and video of the violating vehicles for further analysis
    Alerting the authorities and generating a report for further action

How it Works

The system works as follows:

    The video feed from the cameras installed at the intersection is continuously analyzed using computer vision algorithms to detect the presence of vehicles and their position in the frame.
    The detected vehicles are tracked across multiple frames using object tracking algorithms to ensure that the same vehicle is not detected multiple times.
    The traffic signals at the intersection are also detected and tracked using computer vision algorithms.
    The position of the detected vehicles is compared with the position of the traffic signals to determine whether the vehicle has violated the traffic signal.
    If a violation is detected, the system captures and stores images and video of the violating vehicle for further analysis.
    The authorities are alerted and a report is generated for further action.
